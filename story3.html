    Boys and girls from New York City came to the Bronx on a recent Saturday to play tennis, eat supper and learn valuable life lessons. They didn’t expect to spend three hours with cops from the 42nd precinct.
  </p>


  <p>
    “These kids never knew that they were playing and having a blast with police officers. And when you see their face when the police officers come down for dinner, they’re shocked,” said Tony Huber, who runs the Serve & Connect tennis program.
  </p>


  <p>
    Over the 10-week course, kids are taught about respect, teamwork and discipline by coaches and police officers, as a way to bridge the gap between cops and their communities.
  </p>


  <p>
    The Cary Leeds Center for Tennis & Learning in Crotona Park in the Bronx is a public/private organization that hosts tournaments and provides free access to professional tennis instructors for kids. It is the flagship facility within the New York Junior Tennis & Learning system, which has operated for 45 years, and serves 75,000 kids across all five boroughs in New York City. Its programs are created to improve the character of young people on and off the courts.
  </p>


  <p>
    “Through tennis and education, we set you up for success in life,” said Huber, the center’s co-director and professional tennis coach. “In every program that we do there is some life-skill component that we add to the tennis program, because we don’t just want you to be a good tennis player, we’d rather you be a good person.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Shawn Mitchell Yon, 13, wakes up on weekends at 5 a.m. “For tennis, he gets up on his own. For school, I’ve got to drag him out of bed,” said Shawn’s father. It’s still dark outside when they leave their house in St. Albans, Queens, for the 45-minute drive to the Bronx.
  </p>

    <p>
    Yon has been coming to Cary Leeds for three years. He recently qualified for their tournament team after completing the center’s Intensive Training Program (ITP). He also joined the center’s new volunteer mentor program, designed to provide him with leadership skills and give younger kids someone to look up to.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I was one of the original participants of the ITP, and since I improved from my program so much, I want to give back to the other kids, so whatever I learned, I can teach them, so they can become better tennis players. Better than me one day. Possibly turn pro,” said Yon.

    Huber has run the center for the past year and a half with his wife Liezel, the center’s executive director. In her professional tennis career, she has won seven Grand Slam titles, competed in the Olympics three times and received a Humanitarian Award from Sir Richard Branson.
  </p>

    <p>
    “We’re a tennis center, an educational center, and a community center,” said Huber. “We don’t just do tennis. We do SAT prep free of charge. We bring in someone that helps kids code.” The center works with public schools and homeless shelters in the Bronx, inviting kids and their parents to play tennis and learn new skills.

  <p>
  Mark Oljaca, 29, is a professional tennis player, and has been coaching kids at the center for the last six months. “For me, the greatest joy is giving these kids a head start that I didn’t necessarily have,” said Oljaca.
</p>

  <p>
  The center was named after professional tennis player Cary Leeds, who died in 2003 at the age of 45. Larry Leeds, an apparel industry magnate, wanted to memorialize his son Cary and give back to the community. Leeds secured donations from fashion industry icons Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Kenneth Cole, among others, and provided more than half of the $26.5 million for the center’s construction.
</p>

  <p>
  The Cary Leeds Center opened on June 15, 2015, in partnership with New York Junior Tennis & Learning and the United States Tennis Association. It serves as a model for National Junior Tennis & Learning centers throughout the country. The NYC Department of Parks and Recreation helps operate the center, which is open to the public all year.
</p>

  <p>
  Liezel and Tony Huber also own a tennis club in Houston, Texas, but it’s a for-profit facility serving mostly middle-class families. They moved to New York City a year and a half ago to dedicate their time helping underserved communities. “To do the things that this place does, we can’t be there too,” said Huber.
