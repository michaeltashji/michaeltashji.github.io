  <p>
  On a Sunday in late January 2012, Fr. Thomas Fenlon and his congregants entered St. Augustine’s Catholic church for the last time. They gathered up the statues and other sacred items and marched in procession for nearly a mile to their new house of worship, where Fr. Peter Gavigan welcomed them into the fold.
  </p>


  <p>
  “That day, I knew it was going to happen, and we were all happy about it,” said Linda Boney, a parishioner at St. Augustine’s for 22 years. “But when I was processing, it felt like a death. It hit me like a brick. And then, when we came and we saw everybody with their signs welcoming us, that’s when the joy came back.”
  </p>


  <p>
  After decades of suffering losses in membership, St. Augustine’s church was closed in 2009 as a result of debt and disrepair. The remaining congregants met in a school next door, which the church owned and operated. Three years later, the church leased the school building to a private charter, leaving parishioners with no place left to worship.

  <p>
  Beginning in 2012, the Catholic Archdiocese of New York closed 55 churches and merged parishes in the face of dwindling congregations. St. Augustine’s Church in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx was the prototype for these mergers. The beloved “Cathedral of The South Bronx,” built in 1849, was torn down. Worshipers were dispatched to Our Lady of Victory Church in the nearby neighborhood of Claremont, and were asked to join together as one community.

  “It was a little rocky at first. It’s hard on both sides,” said Adrienne Hennessey, who attended St. Augustine’s Church for 60 years. “We had our hurt feelings about not having our church anymore. I’m sure Our Lady of Victory, some felt very welcoming, but then on the other hand, here were these other people just coming into their church.”
  </p>

  <p>
  When St. Augustine’s was founded, its congregation was comprised of German and Irish Catholics. After the Second World War, these families fled the South Bronx for the suburbs. The parish became predominantly black. Over the last twenty years, the Bronx has seen a rise in Puerto Rican and Dominican populations. More recently, new immigrants from Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana have made the Bronx their home.

  Fr. George Stewart is the rector of the conjoined St. Augustine’s–Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church. He came on board in 2015. His former parish in the Bronx, St. Brendan’s, was merged with St. Ann’s, so he knows the challenge his church faced.
  </p>


  <p>
  Stewart is white, while 60 percent of his congregants are Hispanic, and 40 percent are Black. The parish is comprised of nearly 500 adults, plus many children. In response to its demographics, the church offers two masses each Sunday, one in Spanish and the other in English. To reflect their growing Garifuna population, it hosts one service a month in the Igñeri dialect, a combination of Arahuaco, French, Swahili and Bantu.

  Stewart said his main concern was engaging young people. “A parish is only as healthy as the next generation. Otherwise you’re looking at your demise. It’s been one of my focuses to draw not just children but teenagers and young adults. Around the time of the mergers, there were a lot of second and third generations that did not follow in the footsteps of their parents.”
  </p>

  <p>
  One approach Stewart used to multiply his flock is a supper club and bible study program called Christ Life. When he began the program last year, he hoped for a dozen people to attend.
  </p>

  <p>
  “I was hoping for twelve good people to come out. It seemed to work for Jesus,” said Stewart. One hundred sixty souls turned out for the event.
