<p>Parishioners arrived early to pray and invoke the saints and the Virgin Mary. The sound of sirens grew loud each time the front doors were opened. Pews filled up and the smell of flowers and frankincense pervaded.
</p>

<p>At 9:15 a.m., the English-language service started with gospel choir singing, drums and tambourines. It was the first of three services held that Sunday at St. Augustine’s–Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church in the Bronx.
</p>

<p>Beginning in 2012, the Catholic Archdiocese of New York closed 55 churches and merged parishes in the face of dwindling congregations. St. Augustine’s Church in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx was the prototype for these mergers. The beloved “Cathedral of The South Bronx,” built in 1849, was torn down. Worshipers were dispatched to Our Lady of Victory Church in the nearby neighborhood of Claremont. The black and brown communities struggled but ultimately found harmony in their shared faith.

<p>“It was a little rocky at first. It’s hard on both sides. We had our hurt feelings about not having our church anymore. I’m sure Our Lady of Victory, some felt very welcoming, but then on the other hand, here these other people just coming into our church,” said Adrienne Hennessey, who attended St. Augustine’s Church for 60 years.
</p>

<blockquote>
“It felt like a death. It hit me like a brick.”
</blockquote>

<p>After decades of suffering losses in membership, St. Augustine’s church was closed in 2009 as a result of debt and disrepair. The remaining 350 members still met in the school next door, which the church formerly owned and operated. It too had been decommissioned by the Archdiocese and was leased to a private charter school.
</p>

<p>On a Sunday in late January 2012, Fr. Thomas Fenlon and his congregants entered St. Augustine’s for the last time. They gathered up the statues and other sacred items and marched in procession for nearly a mile to their new house of worship. Fr. Peter Gavigan welcomed them into Our Lady of Victory Church on Webster Avenue at a benediction led by Bishop Dennis Sullivan.
</p>

<p>“It’s a healing and a work in progress. That day, I knew it was going to happen and we were all happy about it. But when I was processing here, it felt like a death. It hit me like a brick. And then when we came and we saw everybody with their signs welcoming us. That’s when the joy came back,” said Linda Boney, a parishioner at St. Augustine’s of 22 years.

<p>When St. Augustine’s was founded, its congregation was comprised of German and Irish Catholics. After the Second World War, these families fled the South Bronx for the suburbs. The congregation became predominantly black. Over the last twenty years the Bronx has seen a rise in Puerto Rican and Dominican populations. More recently, new immigrants from Nigeria, Cameroon and Ghana have made the Bronx their home.
</p>

<p>Fr. George Stewart is the rector of the conjoined St. Augustine’s–Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church. He came on board in 2015. He’s been through this before. His former parish in the Bronx, St. Brendan’s, was merged with St. Ann’s.
</p>

<p>Young, white and bilingual, he said his members are 60 percent Latino and 40 percent Black. The church is home to around 475 adults, plus many children.
</p>

<p>In response to the community’s demographics, St. Augustine’s–Our Lady of Victory offers mass in Spanish and in English. To reflect their growing Garifuna population they offer one service a month in the Igñeri dialect, a combination of Arahuaco, French, Swahili and Bantu.

<p>Fr. Stewart said his main concern was engaging young people. “A parish is only as healthy as the next generation. Otherwise you’re looking at your demise. It’s been one of my focuses to draw not just children but teenagers and young adults—and particularly young adults. Around the time of the mergers, there were a lot of second and third generations that did not follow in the footsteps of their parents.”
</p>

<p>One approach Fr. Stewart used to multiply his flock is a program called Christ Life, a supper club and bible study, which helped bring the blended communities together.
</p>

<p>When he began the program last year, he hoped for a dozen people to attend. One hundred sixty souls turned out for the event. “I was hoping for twelve good people to come out. It seemed to work for Jesus.”
