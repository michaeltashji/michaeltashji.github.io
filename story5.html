    After an arraignment, which is when an arrestee is formally charged with a crime, a judge sets bail to ensure that person returns to court. When they appear at trial, their bail money is returned.
  </p>

  <p>
    But if they can’t afford to pay bail, they are incarcerated while they await trial.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s at that point that a misdemeanor crime can turn into a life-altering event. A person in jail can’t go to work and can’t care for their kids, which could mean the loss of a job or custody of a child.
  </p>


  <p>
    The Bronx Freedom Fund, created in 2007 in partnership with The Bronx Defenders, donates bail money to those who otherwise could not afford it. Both organizations share a common purpose—to reduce the number of people entering the criminal justice system. The fund has donated bail money to over 2,100 New Yorkers over the past five years.

    “We work with public defenders. They tell us when their clients have had bail set,” said Elena Weissmann, 27, the organization’s director. “We try to pay their bail as soon as possible.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Bronx, most men awaiting trial are sent to the Vernon C. Bain Correctional Facility. In Queens, they are split between Rikers Island and Bain. In Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island, most are incarcerated at the Manhattan Detention Complex and the Brooklyn Detention Complex. All women citywide are sent to Rikers.

    Some defendants need extra support after they are arrested. The organization would help point them towards outside service providers for job training or addiction treatment programs.
  </p>


  <p>
    “We keep track of case outcomes and when people come back to court—how we can stay in touch with them and what happens with their case,” said Weissmann.

    What began as a 1-person operation has grown into a team of eight, and partners with other legal defenders including The Legal Aid Society.
  </p>

  <p>
    “We also accept referrals from the broader community. We sometimes get calls from jails or we get emails from loved ones on the outside or people come into our office and tell us about their loved one or friend or contact who’s in and can’t make bail,” said Weissmann.

  <p>
    The organization meets with every client to make sure they have a place to go and they know when to come back to court. It sends clients reminders to keep them in compliance.
  </p>

  <p>
    “New York State is unique in having separate laws that govern charitable bail organizations or community bail funds. We can only pay bail up to $2,000 under the current statute. The average that we pay is about $1,100,” said Weissmann.
