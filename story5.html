    Someone who has been arrested must post bail or wait in jail for their day in court. When someone is in jail, they can’t go to work and they can’t care for their children. A misdemeanor arrest can turn into a life-changing event. The Bronx Freedom Fund donates bail money to those who otherwise could not afford it.
  </p>

  <p>
    “We work with public defenders. They tell us when their clients have had bail set,” said Elena Weissmann, 27, the organization’s director. “We try to pay their bail as soon as possible.”

    The Bronx Freedom Fund was created in 2007 in partnership with The Bronx Defenders. Both organizations share a common purpose—to reduce the number of people entering the criminal justice system. The fund has donated bail money to over 2,100 New Yorkers over the past five years.
  </p>

  <p>
    After someone is arrested and arraigned, bail is set. The defendant meets with a representative of the Criminal Justice Agency for an interview. Every arrestee is asked to provide demographic information, including if they are caring for a child or dependent at home.

    “We have found that the data is not totally accurate, because it is being gathered through a bullet proof glass window. They’re meeting for the first time, and people are really scared,” said Weissmann.
  </p>


  <p>
    Some clients need extra support after they are arrested. The organization would then point them towards outside service providers to help with job training, addiction treatment programs or shelters.

    “We keep track of case outcomes and when people come back to court—how we can stay in touch with them and what happens with their case,” said Weissmann.
  </p>

  <p>
    What began as a 1-person operation has grown into a team of eight. The organization now serves clients in the Bronx and Queens, and partners with other legal defenders including The Legal Aid Society.

    “We also accept referrals from the broader community. We sometimes get calls from jails or we get emails from loved ones on the outside or people come into our office and tell us about their loved one or friend or contact who’s in and can’t make bail,” said Weissmann.
  </p>

  <p>
    The organization meets with every client to make sure they want to be bailed out, they have a place to go and they know when to come back to court. It sends clients reminders to keep them in compliance.
  </p>


  <p>
    “New York is unique in having separate laws that govern charitable bail organizations or community bail funds. We can only pay bail up to $2,000 under the current statute. The average that we pay is about $1,100,” said Weissmann.
