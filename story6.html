     Hundreds of New Yorkers braved the cold to stand in line for a chance to visit Gracie Mansion for the Annual Holiday Open House. Mayor Bill de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray were not in attendance for the event, but their staff took every measure to welcome the public into “The People’s House.”
   </p>

   <p>
     Children and adults weaved their way through the historic home and took family photos in front of the Christmas tree. A tent was set up on the grounds where visitors enjoyed cookies and cider while Christmas tunes played over loudspeakers.

    Built in 1799, Gracie Mansion sits at E. 88th St. and East End Avenue in Manhattan, overlooking the East River. It has served as the mayoral residence since 1942.

    Rosemary Rivera visited the house for the first time with her two friends. They were at the head of the line and wore matching Santa hats. Rivera has lived in New York City for 67 years and recently retired from her job at the New York City Board of Education.

    “I saw the free tickets. Actually, I wanted to come on Halloween. They had a Halloween special. We missed it, so I told the girls, come on—we got free tickets. I brought them both from the Bronx over here,” said one of Rivera’s friends.

    Visitors Daniel and Kristin Fiss moved to New York from Vancouver, British Columbia. She works as a consultant for Deloitte. He works as an engineer on the new Lenox Avenue subway station in Harlem.

    “We spent our first Christmas in New York last year. We didn’t have any furniture so we ate Christmas Eve dinner on a box on the floor,” said Fiss.

    Grace Valle, 43, was born in Haiti and moved to New York City when she was six years old. She works as a dental hygienist and lives in Jamaica, Queens. It was her first time visiting Gracie Mansion.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Breathtaking. Amazing. I would encourage other people to come to this historic mansion and learn about it,” said Valle. “I came early, before my appointments, hoping to see the mayor—at least to say hello. I think a lot of people were hoping to see the mayor.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Now I get to talk to my patients about my adventure today,” said Valle, as flakes of snow began to fall from the early December sky.
