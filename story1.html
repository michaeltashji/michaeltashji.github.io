  <p>After years of working in hospitals, restaurants, and construction sites, these three Bronx residents from the CD3 are exploring ways to escape New York.</p>

  <p>Luis Rivera, 61, lives in Melrose, but is planning to go back to Puerto Rico. He made appointments and handled payments for 31 years at NYC Health & Hospitals/Lincoln.
  </p>

  <p>Standing outside the bodega where he buys his morning coffee, he admits, “Here, I stay in my apartment. There’s too much crime.”
  </p>

  <p> “The island is different. I walk to the beach in five minutes. I know the island,” says Mr. Rivera.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  “Here, I stay in my apartment. There’s too much crime.”
  </blockquote>

  <p> Ms. Lee has lived in Morrisania for 33 years, and can be found most days at the public library on 169th Street. She hosts community bus trips to Atlantic City, Sesame Place, and Dorney Park.” Now 66, she retired two years ago. “I don’t want to sit in my house all alone.”
  </p>

  <p> “They used to call this place Fort Apache. I saw them film that here. Paul Newman is such a handsome man. But he’s much shorter than I realized.”
  </p>

  <p> A regular visitor of Grant Park, Zdzislaw is of Polish descent and has lived in Claremont for 11 years.
  </p>

  <p> “I’m one of the only white guys, and the only one to speak Spanish.”
  </p>

  <p> Zdzislaw worked in construction, and was part of the clean up crew at Ground Zero after 9/11. “Me, all of us, we have mental symptoms. Lungs. Stomach.” He was entered into The World Trade Center Health Program at Mount Sinai Hospital, and visits there regularly.
  </p>

  <p> He too plans to leave The Bronx for the Dominican Republic, and come back four times a year for his medical treatments. “To me, the Dominican Republic means more freedom. And everybody likes freedom.”
